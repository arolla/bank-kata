# Rules
Your PO gives you as an acceptance test the following scenario:
```
Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012
And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012
And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012
When she prints her bank statement
Then she would see
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00 
```

The specifications constrain you with this interface (due to business contract between your boss and your customers):

>	void deposit(String amount); 

>	void withdrawal(String amount);

>	String getStatement();
